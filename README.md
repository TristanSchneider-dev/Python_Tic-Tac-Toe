# Python_Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. The game is played on a 3x3 board, where two players take turns placing either an "X" or an "O". The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins the game. The game ends in a draw if all cells are filled and no player has won.

The repository contains a single Python file with the game logic. The code is easy to follow, making it a great learning resource for beginners who want to practice their Python skills.

Feel free to clone the repository and modify the code to add new features or improve the game's functionality. Contributions are welcome!
